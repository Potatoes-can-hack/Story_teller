    engine.say("I found myself on the ground, too weak to even open my eyes, I was lying on some sort of moss, a very soft and comfortable moss even softer than my bed at home, then it struck me, what was I doing lying on the ground? Why wasn’t I in my bed at home? Where was I? What is this place? As I opened my eyes the sunlight blazed into my eyes as if there was the heat and light of a thousand embers burning, so powerful was this sun. It took me some time to adjust to my surroundings, there were trees, tall trees, the bark as dark as the fur of a bear, but not perfectly sculpted, the bark was rough, I could make it out from a distance, the crown of the tree was big and lush as green as a green meadow where the cow’s graze at my grandad’s farm, it was perfectly shaped just like the top of a mushroom it looked like a fitting crown for a tall tree so majestic. I then looked around; I was in a clearing in the forest a large clearing, the trees were a few meters away but the cast a dark and cool shade over the clearing, except where I was, I wondered why, I mustered enough strength to get up and see more, it took an exceptional amount of time since I was flushed, but I did. Once I got up, I stretched my arms and started walking a bit but that was a mistake. I fell. I realized the issue about the shade but thought it was the least of my problems right now, as I fell, I scraped and scratched through many branches and just when I thought I was done for I heard a “Swoosh” and a “Swish” and then a “Thump!” I was one something soft, something rubbery and jelly-like at the same time rough and uncomfortable, I had been saved but I now needed to figure out whether I was in the hands of a friend or was I the bread on the table.I saw that I was on a DRAGON! The dragon had scales in the vibrant color of the sun, tiny nail like structures on its paws, tiny but immensely powerful wings, with an underside of the green color of the forest trees and grass, it had a friendly smile on its face which re-assured me and green eyes with a tinge of dark yellow and two ever-flaring nostrils, you might be telling right now that “But that’s how every dragon looks like” well you are wrong, WRONG, WRONG! There was a feeling of homeliness, a feeling of warmth and care, not like the war-like attitude of a regular dragon. I thought this mighty flying beast was the forest guardian because of its mellow color and resemblance to the forest, just as we passed the clearing, I saw some sort of a spirally, swirly thing switching and changing colors from purple to shades of blue, some sort of a portal a wormhole maybe but I established the idea that I had come from there and I needed to get back there. I fell, tired and sleepy.I woke up a few hours later, the dragon had brought me to a its den and had some yellow gooey in a shell beside me, I guess it wanted me to eat that, I dipped my finger in and tasted it, to my surprise it was honey but not any honey this tasted different, sweet but not too sweet, yet it was perfect, I took the shell and gulped down all the honey at once my body was flushed with energy, I ran out of the den and found myself falling again to my relief the dragon came and caught me snickering a bit but also worried.As we reached the top of the cliff near the dragon’s den, I pointed towards the portal trying to tell it that I needed to get there as it was the way to my home it seemed to understand and we set out toward the wormhole a storm was brewing in the vicinity I realized I needed to get past that, the dragon glided past the dark clouds of the vicinity, but when we reached the clearing near the portal it was hopeless, there was a mighty fine tornado, perfectly horrible, the dragon seemed to be struggling but just as we reached the storm I was flung away towards its swirling mass I thought this was the end as I was really close to the end but the dragon glided and whooshed using the swirl of the tornado to its advantage it came near me and flung towards the ledge of the portal which was covered with mosses and net like brambles, with vines hanging all around, the dragon was falling swiftly into the tornado I needed to do something quick, I threw down a vine but it ripped, there was no hope, I then saw a thicker vine, tightened it and attached the net like, thorny bramble to it, I threw it down to the dragon hoping it would get stuck and I could pull it up but the dragon was too low but managed to grab the vines, I tried to pull it up but to no avail but flung the vine toward the side of the storm, I thought the dragon was gone but it used the power of the storm and after a few maneuvers reached the ledge where I was, I hugged the dragon it was warm and it hugged me back, as we saw the trees of the forest being ripped away we thought that there was no hope going back we needed to go through…As we went through I was flushed through all of my energy my vision was distorted and blurred I lost my sense of smell, this continued for some time but after that I heard a thud and fell it wasn’t a long fall, I landed on a grass field, and I moved my hands, I could touch the dragon he was lying on the ground tired and miserable just like me, I felt I couldn’t do anything else and decided to rest, “Just one more thing” I said to the dragon “Is it okay if I call you North”, the dragon chuckled, “Okay then North, you did great today, time to get a good rest”,  we both smiled flushed as we were, a calm sense of relief hit us, a sense of rest after a tremendous journey as we fell into a deep slumber.")

    engine.say("This is a story of a little girl, her name is Sakshi, Sakshi is very playful and kind but more interestingly she has the incredible power to doze off anytime, anywhere. Sakshi loved to sit in her tree house, or so she calls it, it is just a big, thick, and rough branch backyard’s biggest mango tree.A typical Sunday morning, she was sitting on her ‘tree house’ she dozed off and due to lack of balance, she fell, THE END, just kidding it is not the end so as she fell an eagle named Kappa (weird name) was gobbling millions upon millions of mangoes, but then he saw Sakshi, instinctively he swooped downwards with his fine mango-covered sloppy wings and broke her fall, then he flew high in the sky, above the clouds with Sakshi still on his back (Still sleeping). Meanwhile the God of thunder appeared close to Sakshi’s mango tree to feast on some fine mangoes, but to his dismay there were no mangoes, he then used his Hocus-pocus, magic powers and found out that Kappa had eaten all the mangoes, as we all know that Gods have a quick temper, then he used GPS tracking to pinpoint the location of Kappa, he then resumed his place in the clouds and summoned lightning…The God of Thunder ordered the lightning to go onto reverse mode and bomb Kappa, but the lightning missed Kappa from over a mile because they were using a free GPS with tons and tons of ads which were very annoying. The God of thunder bought the lightning bolts a good GPS with no ads after this incident but unfortunately had burned through a lot of his pocket money (Guess he must beg his mom the next time he needs to buy bubblegum). Finally, the lightning found Kappa and started bombing him, Kappa realizing that he was a prime target decided to duck under the clouds and before he knew it, he was under the clouds. Meanwhile the lightning which was still going on reverse mode hit the God of Thunder and poked him straight in the eye (Now he looks like a pirate), the God of Thunder who was furious gave them a nice spanking.Kappa who was underwater now got electrocuted by a bunch of eels who had done the job of the lightning. Seeing this the god of Thunder recruited the eels and fired the lightning so be out on the watch for lightning but with eels in it. Kappa who was still ‘swimming’ under water got poked by pufferfish, inked by octopi, and got licked by dolphins (Which was really, gross, he vowed that once he got home, he would describe dolphins as sinister face-licking monsters), during this luckily, he shielded Sakshi, who unbelievably was still asleep.After the encounter with the sinister face-licking monster, Kappa decided that Sakshi was nothing but a trouble magnet, attracting trouble towards him, he thought “Enough is enough, I’m going to drop this trouble magnet at her ‘branch-where-she-sits-every-Sunday’ thing and go back to finishing of mangoes” and so he did Kappa flew Sakshi back to her garden and flew far-far away to a much more bigger mango tree, never to see Sakshi ever again.Wow, what a journey Sakshi had just been through without even realizing it, unbelievably Sakshi was still sleeping, I wonder what will happen once she wakes up?")

    engine.say("Ahh… feel the lovely, fresh, and lush breeze of a beautiful village filled with lush green fields, grazing sheep with wool as white as the clouds in the beautiful blue sky complete with strokes of orange and sometimes even devil red just to touch up the appearance of the sky just a few hours before a rosy evening sunset.I hurriedly urged my brother Dev who was ambitiously trying to catch one of the many white sheep on the moor, only to get kicked on the face over-and-over again, you might admire him for his determination, but to me it is just pure foolishness, anyways I was just telling him to head back to our granny’s home, eh, no point bothering he’s just going to yell five more minutes from the grassy field, and not come back till I yell at him again, I’m going to try that one more time and then leave him as a yummy snack for all the big, bad monsters out there.Dev can sometimes be a stubborn little boy, I finally got him to listen up but at a cost… it always comes with a cost… he wanted to me to give me half of my snack today (You could call him caring but that would be pure irony), eh, no big deal I do not like them anyway, but what I do like are the hand-picked raspberries of my grandma’s backyard, oh I live for them.When I finally, finally, finally, got Dev to listen to me, on we went towards home, the sky was already turning midnight blue with just a few streaks of sunlight left, I worried that we might not get back in time but shunned that thought at once.As we cautiously marched our way back home, I thought it was taking too much time, the scenery changed and instead of a dusty and rocky village road, it looked like a forest a forest with short and stout, leafless and dead willow trees, suddenly a thick mist started, along with the howl of wolves, I checked back to make sure that Dev was still behind me, but he was not.I was miserable just despised with the thought of my brother gone but I had to move on only then there was a hope a flicker of light to guide me back to him.As I turned to continue, I saw a wolf it was tall, with a coat of snow white, just to top it off with a few spots of black and brown, and a lovely mane of jet black, unlike any other I had ever seen, it gave a feeling of strength and bravery instead of a sinister feel I had gotten from every other I had seen, it had glowing blue eyes and once I had documented it completely it ran.Instinctively I followed the wolf, only to lose it again, this time I was on a street, something that looked like the one of my own village surrounded by a carpet of green grass but there was nothing surrounding it till all I could see, but up north I could see something, something tall and sleek with a blood red flag on top of it, somewhat like an obelisk but bade out of rocks you could find in medieval times, big and gray rocks which gave a majestic look to any royal palace, but also a mysterious and haunting look.I moved forward only to get the haunting image clearer and clearer until the earth started rumbling, it was shaking vigorously, few of the turrets shook and the weaker ones even fell, creating a disturbing, crashing sound spewing rocks all over the place, slowly a section of the earth started rising, and there was something strange underneath, it was like a shell a turtle shell precisely, and underneath was the body of a beast a four legged beast, it was rising with the castle on its shell like projection, amidst all of this I was trying to keep myself stable and trying not to get killed.The beast had finally risen totally, I was speechless by its sheer size let alone the mighty castle on the top of its shell, to keep it short I would describe it like this – a turtle – yes it looked exactly like a turtle, a turtle with a castle on it shell, it was blue in color with triangular spots near its limbs, its eyes glowed green and it had a red underbelly with black stripes, but there was something at the top, just above its eyes… It was Dev.")
